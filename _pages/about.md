<h1 style="color: navy;">Hi, here's KJ!</h1>

I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at School of Communication, University of Technology Sydney, and a member of the Center for Future Media & Human-Machine Communication, supervised by Dr. Paul Bron, Dr. Kai Lin & A/Prof. Amelia Johns.

I am also a member of The International Student Training Network (ISTN) 2024-2026. ISTN is a program of the International Partnership for Queer Youth Resilience (INQYR), a research partnership between universities and community organizations across Canada, the US, the UK, Mexico, and Australia.

Before joining UTS, I completed my Bachelor of Communication (Honours) in Media and Communication Studies at Beijing Normal-Hong Kong Baptist University (Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Runze Ding).
